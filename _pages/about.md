我第一次接触到合成孔径雷达干涉 (InSAR) 是本科读遥感专业，承蒙恩师焦健老师、曾琪明老师启蒙，从此对 InSAR 的热爱一发不可收拾，十年间辗转香港、美国、荷兰多地求学、工作。为了知其所以然，读过遥感、地球科学、测绘、EE；钻研过学术，也在业界做过各种项目；当过研究僧，也干过程序猿。如今是西北工业大学电子信息学院教师一名。热爱一切与 InSAR/SAR 有关的算法、开发与应用([什么是 InSAR?](https://www.construction.cam.ac.uk/news/sakthy-selvakumaran-tedx-talk){:target="\_blank"})。致力于在合成孔径雷达地表监测的应用中提高监测精度，扩大应用场景，让 SAR/InSAR 这个工具更多、更广地服务于各行各业。

My journey with SAR/InSAR started more than 10 years ago at Peking University. I was introduced to the world of SAR/InSAR by my mentor, [Prof. Jiao Jian](https://sess.pku.edu.cn/english/people/researcharea/remote/270018.htm){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Zeng Qiming](https://sess.pku.edu.cn/english/people/researcharea/remote/270016.htm){:target="\_blank"}. I'm currently an associate professor at the School of Electronics and Information of Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.

I am always fascinated by how delicate and elegant the SAR system is. From time to time, I'm still thrilled by the fact that SAR satellites from 800km away can capture millimeter level ground movement accurately.

A few of my interests include:
  - SAR interferometric processing and interpretation;
  - InSAR multi-temporal time series analysis;
  - Algorithms & Software development for (In)SAR;
  - Ground monitoring & earth observation applications.
